# WiFiNINA Library


This library allows you to use the Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, Arduino NANO 33 IoT, Arduino MKR 1010 and Arduino MKR VIDOR 4000 WiFi capabilities. It can serve as either a server accepting incoming connections or a client making outgoing ones. The library supports WEP, WPA2 Personal and WPA2 Enterprise encryptions. This library support all the same methods of the original WiFi library plus the connectSSL(). The WiFiNINA library is very similar to the Ethernet and the library WiFi, and many of the function calls are the same.

To use this library

```
#include <SPI.h>
#include <WiFiNINA.h>
```

## Examples

Several examples for the **WiFiNINA** library are available from the [Examples from Libraries page](https://docs.arduino.cc/library-examples/).
